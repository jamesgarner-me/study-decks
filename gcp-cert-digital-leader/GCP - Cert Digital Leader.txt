Migrate the workloads to Compute Engine with a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) model</div></div></div></li></ul><div><br></div>	<div><strong>D is correct</strong>&nbsp;because migrating the workloads to Compute Engine with a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) model can effectively optimize license costs. With the PAYG model, you don't need to renew your Windows Server licenses separately. Instead, the licensing cost is included in the hourly pricing of the virtual machine instances on Compute Engine. This means you only pay for the instances when they are running during working hours, and you can shut them down during weekends or other periods when they are not needed. By taking advantage of the pay-as-you-go model, you can align your license costs with the actual usage of the workloads and optimize your expenses.</div><div><br></div><div><div>C is incorrect because migrating the workloads to Compute Engine with a bring-your-own-license (BYOL) model may not be the most cost-effective solution in this scenario. The BYOL model requires you to utilize your existing Windows Server licenses, but the licenses are up for renewal in a month. Renewing the licenses and then migrating them to Compute Engine may not be the most efficient approach in terms of cost optimization.</div><div><br></div></div>

GCP - Cert Digital Leader	<div><div>You are working at an inter-design studio where you need to provide the designers with a Cloud-based rendering service to render their designs. The rendering can be interrupted at any time and can be restarted later. Any individual scene rendering takes less than 12 hours to complete, and there is no service-level agreement (SLA) for the completion time for all scenes. Results will be stored in a global Cloud Storage bucket. The compute resources can be in any geographical location. How to run this software on Google Cloud in a cost-optimized way?</div></div><ul><li><div></div><div><div><div>A. Use preemptible instances to deploy the application on Compute Engine</div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div><div>B.

Create a reservation for the minimum number of Compute Engine instances you will use</div></div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div>D. Start more instances with fewer virtual centralized processing units (vCPUs) instead of fewer instances with more vCPUs</div></div></div></li></ul>	<div><strong>A is correct</strong>&nbsp;because deploying the application on Compute Engine using preemptible instances is a cost-optimized approach for the given requirements. Preemptible instances are highly discounted virtual machines that have a finite lifespan and can be terminated by Google Cloud at any time with short notice. They are suitable for workloads that can tolerate interruptions and don't require strict completion time guarantees. Since each individual scene rendering takes less than 12 hours to complete, preemptible instances can be utilized effectively. These instances can be started and interrupted at any time without impacting the overall rendering process. They offer significant cost savings compared to regular instances, making them a suitable choice for a cost-optimized solution.</div><div><br></div><div><div>D is incorrect because starting more instances with fewer virtual CPUs (vCPUs) instead of fewer instances with more vCPUs does not inherently optimize costs. The number of instances and vCPUs should be determined based on the actual workload requirements and performance considerations rather than as a cost optimization strategy.</div><div><br></div></div>	
GCP - Cert Digital Leader	<div><div>You are working as a Cloud Architect at a financial institution and you need to prevent the VMs created in your environments from having internet access.

GCP - Cert Digital Leader	What is an SLA?	An SLA (service level agreement) is an agreement between provider and client about measurable metrics like uptime, responsiveness, and responsibilities.<br><br>Represents the promises you’re making to customers—and the consequences if you fail to live up to those promises. Typically, consequences include financial penalties, service credits, or license extensions.	
GCP - Cert Digital Leader	What is an SLO?	<ul><li>An SLO (service level objective) is an agreement within an SLA about a specific metric like uptime or response time.</li><li>So, if the SLA is the formal agreement between you and your customer, SLOs are the individual promises you’re making to that customer. </li><li>SLOs are what set customer expectations and tell IT and DevOps teams what goals they need to hit and measure themselves against.</li></ul>	
GCP - Cert Digital Leader	What is an SLI?	<ul><li>An SLI (service level indicator) measures compliance with an SLO (service level objective). </li><li>So, for example, if your SLA specifies that your systems will be available 99.95% of the time, your SLO is likely 99.95% uptime and your SLI is the actual measurement of your uptime. Maybe it’s 99.96%. Maybe 99.99%. </li><li>To stay in compliance with your SLA, the SLI will need to meet or exceed the promises made in that document.</li></ul>	
GCP - Cert Digital Leader	What is a Hypervisor?	A&nbsp;<em>hypervisor</em>&nbsp;allows one host computer to support multiple guest&nbsp;<em>VMs</em>&nbsp;by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.	
GCP - Cert Digital Leader	<div><div>You are starting a new project in your company that will be deployed on Google Cloud. You need separate development and production environments. The production environment will be deployed in Compute Engine in two regions. Which structure should your organization choose for the resource hierarchy?</div></div><ul><li><div></div><div><div><div><div>A. Create a single project for all environments. Segregate resources by environment using labels.</div></div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div><div>B. Create a single project for all environments. Segregate resources by environment using tags.</div></div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div>C. Create one project for the development environment and one project for the production environment.</div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div><div>D. Create two projects for the development environment and two projects for the production environment (one for each region).</div></div></div></div></li></ul><div><br></div>	<div><strong>C is correct</strong>&nbsp;because it provides a clear separation between the development and production environments by creating separate projects for each. This allows for better isolation, management, and control of resources in each environment. By having one project for the development environment and one project for the production environment, you can maintain independent configurations, access controls, and resource usage for each environment.</div><div><br></div>	
GCP - Cert Digital Leader	<div><div>You are working as a finance officer at your company and you accidentally purchased a 1-year Committed Use Discount when you wanted to purchase for 3 years instead.

One project per team.</div></div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div><div>B. One organization per team.</div></div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div><div>C. One project that contains all of each team's resources.</div></div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div>D. One top-level folder per team.</div></div></div></li></ul><div><br></div>	<div><strong>D is correct</strong>&nbsp;because Google recommends using one top-level folder per team to segment Google Cloud resources. This approach provides a logical and organized structure for resource management within a Google Cloud organization. Each team can have its own dedicated folder, and resources belonging to that team can be placed within that folder. This helps reduce operational risk by providing a clear separation between teams and their resources. It also allows for better cost visibility as resources are grouped together at the folder level, making it easier to track and manage costs associated with each team's resources.</div><div><br></div>	
GCP - Cert Digital Leader	<div><div>Your leadership has asked you to explain how do Migrate for Compute Engine and Migrate for Anthos differ from each other. How should you explain the difference?</div></div><ul><li><div></div><div><div><div><div>A. Migrate for Compute Engine assumes that the migration source is VMware vSphere, while Migrate for Anthos does not have that assumption.</div></div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div><div>B. Migrate for Compute Engine charges for ingress, while Migrate for Anthos does not.</div></div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div><div>C. Migrate for Compute Engine is closed source, while Migrate for Anthos is open source.</div></div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div>D. Migrate for Anthos migrates to containers, while Migrate for Compute Engine migrates to virtual machines.</div></div></div></li></ul><div><br></div>	<div><strong>D is correct</strong>&nbsp;because Migrate for Anthos is designed to migrate workloads to containers, while Migrate for Compute Engine is focused on migrating workloads to virtual machines. It enables the modernization and containerization of workloads. On the other hand, Migrate for Compute Engine is focused on migrating virtual machines, meaning it helps to move VM-based workloads to Google Cloud's Compute Engine infrastructure.</div><div><br></div>	
GCP - Cert Digital Leader	<div><div>Your work at a large enterprise with thousands of users. The users are managed through LDAP, which stores users’ passwords and group organization membership.

Replicate the LDAP infrastructure on Compute Engine</div></div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div><div>B. Use the Firebase Authentication REST API to create users</div></div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div><div>C. Use Google Cloud Directory Sync to create users</div></div></div></div></li><li><div></div><div><div><div><div>D. Use the Identity Platform REST API to create users</div></div></div></div></li></ul><div><br></div>	<div><strong>C is correct</strong>&nbsp;because Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) is a tool that enables organizations to synchronize their on-premises LDAP directory with Google Workspace and Google Cloud. By configuring GCDS, you can provision and manage Google accounts and groups based on the user information stored in the on-premises LDAP database. This allows you to maintain consistency and synchronization between the on-premises LDAP infrastructure and the Google Cloud resources.</div><div><br></div>	
GCP - Cert Digital Leader	<div><div>Your company has recently migrated an app to Google Cloud. This app needs to communicate with a database that is on-premises.
